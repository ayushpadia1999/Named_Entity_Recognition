# Named_Entity_Recognition
This Named Entity Recognition using a bi-directional LSTM with Keras project was created to Solve the Named Entity Recognition (NER) . In natural language processing, named entity recognition (NER) is the problem of recognizing and extracting specific types of entities in text. Such as people or place names. In fact, any concrete “thing” that has a name. The project has a huge number of applications and is extensively used in NLP . Some use cases are:
Search
An important one is in web search. By understanding the entities in a query, search engines deliver better results. Google uses this approach.
Indexing documents
Another important one is in cataloging or indexing text documents such as web pages or online articles. This involves extracting the salient entities in a document and indexing the document using these. Online magazines and news publishers do this a lot. And of course search engines.
Product reviews
A third use case is in extracting product names or other salient entities from online reviews in a retail setting. These reviews may be at eCommerce sites or at social media ones. Clearly it is useful to know which products and features are being discussed in a particular review.
Entities in emails
A fourth use case is in detecting and extracting entities from emails and automatically triggering certain actions. Many readers might have seen this happening on their own smart devices.
Building a structured database from a corpus
A fifth use case is in building a structured database by recognizing entities of the desired type from a corpus.
